## Description

This script generates a personalized birthday card by overlaying a background image with custom text and sender information. It utilizes the PIL (Python Imaging Library) module to create and manipulate the card's components.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

## Usage

1. Place your preferred background image in the project folder and update the `BACKGROUND_IMAGE_PATH` variable in the script to point to the image file.
2. Customize the `MESSAGE` and `SENDER_NAME` variables to personalize the card's message and sender information.
3. Ensure you have a TrueType font file (`.ttf`) for the text. Update the `FONT_PATH` variable with the path to your chosen font.
4. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python generate_birthday_card.py
```

5. The generated birthday card will be saved as `birthday_card.png` in the project folder.
